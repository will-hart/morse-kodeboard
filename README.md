# Morse Kodeboard

I can type 1,250 words per minute on a keyboard with only the minor side effects
of deafening people within 50 meters and wearing out the delete key inside a week.
It occurs to me that If a TKL keyboard makes me 82.24563x more of an engineer,
then how much more engineer would you become by removing 86 other keys?

Of course disruption requires innovation, and clearly you cant be a 1,000,000x
engineer with only an "a" key. I considered using AI to interpret my intentions
from the velocity and anger with which the key was pressed, but then after a
period of quiet reflection I realised I wasn't insane.  Instead I applied my vast
and terrifying engineering skills to come up with something the likes of which
has never been seen before.

This technological marvel is both simple and truly disruptive. I invented the
idea of using a sequence of long and short pulses to represent the characters I
want to type. I decided to call it a "Morse" coding sequence, named after
[Inspector Morse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092379/) because I once
lived somewhere where an episode was filmed. This new type of keyboard is clearly
more than a keyboard, as without it being a 1,000,000x engineering, isn't possible.
So in honor of the great Inspector, I will call this marvel of modern science a

> **Morse Kodeboard**.

## TLDR

Somehow somebody thought of this idea and I though it would be fun. This is (rust)
firmware for a RP Pico that uses a single button and morse code and pretends to
be a USB keyboard.

I honestly don't know why I did this, I don't even know morse code.
